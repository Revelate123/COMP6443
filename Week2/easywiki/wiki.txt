Found hidden value 4e9800998ecf

on clicking continue with quoccacorp it sends a resquest to quoccaid.quoccacorp.com with the /login?app=4e9800998ecf

which redirects us back to easywiki with a token

the token when decoded from hex does appear to contain admin which is the username I tried

realised thanks to chatgpt that maybe the 2b2b2b2b2b was padding and decoded to +++++
so tried changing admin to melon and omg it worked.
Logged in as melon.
Tried every user listed on quoccaid and the last one TrashPanda has the flag. important the length of the string to be encoded
remained the same.
