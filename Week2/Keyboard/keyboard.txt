Looking at session cookie, there was a secret_key contained in the flask JWT.

Recreating our own flask app using the secret key, we were able to recreate a valid JWT with the data,
{
    "admin": True,
    "secret_key": "$hallICompareTHEE2aSummersday
}

Using the newly generate session cookie, we were able to login as admin.
