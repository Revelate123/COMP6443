We find that when we register a new account, the MFA is generated via a call to an api with the account name and a secret.
The secret is just the username encoded in base32.
We call the api with admin and admin in base32 to get a MFA code, and then use that to login.

For MFA v2.

We just use the same session cookie used in MFA v1 and it works. lol. They should make everyone re do their MFA, legacy ones are vulnerable?
