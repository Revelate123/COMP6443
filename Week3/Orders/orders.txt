page source says there is /upload which doesn't work and is deprecated.

Found robots.txt and it contained /portal and /extractor

Using tar -czvf file.tar.gz ./tmp I create the zip file

The upload lets me upload a file and host it at the addresses specified by the zip file contents

By zipping an absolute path ../../../tmp/z5636887/password we are able to overwrite the
existing password
