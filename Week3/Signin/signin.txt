Logged in and got directed to home
found some information
looked at html and found link to separate sub domain qdns

Using messwithdns thingy I can force the acocunt to re look up the DNS record on signin and it does appear to work.

When the reset password is issued I can alter the records to say whatever I want. I think I can use this for Local File Disclosure
