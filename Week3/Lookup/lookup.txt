Presented with search page, tried typing ' and " got an error.
Tried backtick `, got error saying /bin/something
so tried `ls` and it printed a list of things.
No it didn't it always printed those.
But it does print unexpected EOF when using a single " or ' or `
This means it is probably search a file and does not find a match. 

I think it filters out characters other than . and / by using a regex maybe

; ../../*/[![] did this just work?

 07:15:19 up 34 days, 19:30,  0 user,  load average: 5.17, 4.75, 4.50
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT

This extra stuff was displayed

../../../../ | ../../*/[![] This only displays the extra stuff.

Okay, realised that I could use ? to match the number of chars and did 
 | ../../*/??? ../../????

It is of the format 
ls  Input  | strings
ls ??| ../
