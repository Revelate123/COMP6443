Page has nothing.

Check burpsuite

try robots.txt
Found pages disallowed.
/flag - said no lol
found /admin/dashboard
- has a login page

SELECT user,password FROM db WHERE user = "query" AND password = "query";

SELECT user,password FROM db WHERE user = "query" AND password = "query";

I give up trying SQLI on the login and create a user.

it uses a secret and there is a form to update the secret once logged in.

Probably doing something like

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = user, column2 = password, secret = "query" WHERE user = "user"

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = user, column2 = password, column3 = ""hello ;-- " WHERE username = "abcdefg"

I ended up just signing up as admin with a bunch of spaces and it worked lol.
