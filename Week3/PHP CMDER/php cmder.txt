Presented with form field which does something

Try random php code snips I find online. Does weird things, I don't know php.

Then I try using ls. nothing.

then I try putting a semi colon then ls

bingo.

there is a file called flag.txt.
its a decoy.

then I path traverse to root and see getpassword

the admin page says it is an executable so I run the command

; ./../../../../../getpassword

and it returns the code

which I used to get the flag.
