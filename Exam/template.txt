# COMP6[48]43 Midterm Exam

Do NOT modify the heading structure of this markdown file.

i.e. do not change the existing or create new lines of text starting with `#` or `=` (code comments within backtick (`) delimited code blocks are fine).

Write your answer/writeup for each question under the corresponding heading. For challenges, if you find the flag, include the flag in full at the end of your writeup.

This file should be submitted to Moodle as a text (.txt) file.

Following the above instructions correctly will gain you two bonus marks (capped at 100% marks). All questions are worth 5 marks, for a total of 30 available.

You are welcome (but not required) to use markdown formatting (see https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

Question 6 is designed to be very difficult and should only be attempted if you have solved/made good progress on the rest of the questions.

## Question 1
Looks just like MFA. I try admin admin and it works but now requires MFA. I'm going to try to register just like in the challenge. I intercept the request to proxy. I notice a JWT token but haven't investigated yet.
The JWT contains username and mfa_check. When I post to the /register path it returns a link to a QR code with a secret ORXXA43FMNZGK5BRGIZQ
I decode it from BASE32 and it says topsecret123.
I create a new request replacing tom with admin https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=400x400&data=otpauth://totp/mfa-v1:admin?secret=ORXXA43FMNZGK5BRGIZQ 
I use the QR code to get my nonce and login using admin admin to get the flag.

## Question 2
Another login form, I try entering ' and " to see if it errors and it does on '. SQLI probably the answer.
Request probably looks something like this:
SELECT username,password from users WHERE username = " " and password = "";
Lets try ' OR 1=1; -- c
Got cannot log in as more than one user. This means its probably returning multiple users as my request always return True
Try ' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1; -- c
Got You have been successfully logged into the Wensleydale factory.
You've logged in successfully as TrashPanda but the flag is in another castle!
Lets try OFFSET 1
TRY ' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1; -- c Also wrong user. Lets write a script.
I write a script and find it after like 9 or so users.

## Question 3
Presented with a page immediately.
Got auto logged in as zID but says need to be admin. I close the page and reopen with burpsuit intercepter on.
I see that there is a session cookie with id=12. Simplest cookie ive ever seen. The only other piece of info I can think of would be
my mTLS cert. I try changin the session_id. It works and changes the user. I think I may need another script though.
Found the flag super quick again. Probably didn't need a script.

## Question 4
- Password hash is not passed into cursor.exeute securely it is passed in via curly braces. This means if the password_hash can be overcome somehow,
    then the statement is vulnerable to SQLI
- Password uses sha1 which is an out of date hash function as it has been cryptographically broken according to Wikipedia.
- The app is also in debug mode which allows an attacker to enumerate the application a lot as it sends logging statements. It could also potentially let an   
    attacker access the debugger console which could give them RCE.

## Question 5
presented with admin panel that appears to display whatever i type into the name form. I intercept the request and see that it also sends debug=false
I change it to true before trying RCE. I send a request with random letters. and see that the there is a <code> html that says `/bin/echo &#34;Hello asda&#34; 2&gt;&amp;1`
i think I can use echo to print stuff
lets change this /bin/echo "Hello asda" 2>&1 to /bin/echo "ls -a" 2>&1 by sending ls -a, got Malicious data detected. It must be a WAF.
I try URL encoding the statement but that doesn't work. 
I think they pass my input into the quotes using a template, but I cannot send more quotes so I'm unable to break out of the statement.
I also can't send a \. maybe I can mess with the debug statement instead.
Okay i think adding `&#34;` works 
`name=asd&#34;/bin/echo%20&#34test&#34;&debug=true` isn't quite working
what about a carriage return. Nope.


## Question 6
presented with JWT. The jwt is signed with no payload data.
I look at the source code and not the key.
I think this is an RCE quesiton as there are bash commands in the code with my input passed in. 
I
